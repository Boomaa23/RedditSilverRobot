# RedditSilverRobot
A Reddit bot that gives its own accolade!

Reddit Silver Robot is a redditbot made in April 2017 and is a parody of Reddit's built in "Reddit Gold". Reddit gold is a paid service to show appreciation of another users work on the site. The bot in this project does the same thing on a smaller scale: tells a user it has been given a made up accolade, Reddit Silver.

The mechanics of the bot are simple. You may summon the bot with "!RedditSilver" in a comment, and it will respond with a link to the RedditSilver picture, as well as keep track of how many times each user has given or recieved Reddit Silver. More information on the bot can be found at reddit.com/r/RedditSilverRobot.
